# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alireza, a passionate .NET developer from Iran. Currently, I'm working as a Senior .NET Developer, and I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of web development from back end programming (C#, TypeScript, JavaScript) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS), and more.

I'm always interested in facing new challenges and getting to know more about new technologies. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other enthusiastic developers on exciting programming projects.
